### Practice project
This project is a practice for me. I was reading the chapters Permutation and combinations. So I Just used the formulla here to get the permutations and combinations. 
I know python have built-in packages for these operations. But it was funðŸ˜„.


Factorial
```
n!=nÃ—(nâˆ’1)Ã—(nâˆ’2)Ã—â‹¯Ã—1
n!=nÃ—(nâˆ’1)Ã—(nâˆ’2)Ã—â‹¯Ã—1
Special case: 0!=10!=1
```
Permutation
```
P(n,r)=n!/(nâˆ’r)!
P(n,r)=n!/(nâˆ’r)!
```
Combination
```
C(n,r)=n!/[r!Ã—(nâˆ’r)!]
C(n,r)=n!/[r!Ã—(nâˆ’r)!]
```
